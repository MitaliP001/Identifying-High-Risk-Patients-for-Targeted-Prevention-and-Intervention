## Overview

This GitHub repository hosts the code and documentation for the project "Identifying High-Risk Patients for Targeted Prevention and Intervention," a part of the Data Science 4661 course. The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that identifies patients at high risk of medical complications by leveraging the knowledge and skills acquired during the course.

## Data

The predictive model will be trained on a comprehensive dataset of patient records, encompassing essential information such as demographic details, medical history, and laboratory test results.

## Methodology

Our approach follows a structured data science workflow:

- **Data Preparation**: This step involves loading the dataset, comprehending the features, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling/normalizing numerical features.

- **Data Exploration**: We perform data visualization and analysis to gain valuable insights into data distribution, correlations, and patterns.

- **Model Building**: Multiple machine learning algorithms for classification tasks will be implemented and evaluated. The algorithms in consideration include K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest.

- **Model Selection**: We will select the most effective algorithm based on its performance when tested with separate validation data.

- **Model Deployment (optional)**: If deemed appropriate, the chosen model can be deployed in a real healthcare setting to predict medical complications in new patient data. This process, however, will strictly adhere to relevant data privacy and ethical guidelines.

## Documentation

This project is accompanied by comprehensive documentation that includes:

- **Code**: Detailed code snippets and scripts used throughout the project.
- **Steps Taken**: A clear and concise account of the actions taken at each stage.
- **Algorithm Rationale**: An explanation behind the choices of preprocessing steps and model evaluation criteria.
- **Model Evaluation**: Detailed insights into how well each model performs and the reasons for selecting the final model.

## Ethical and Legal Considerations

Ethical and legal aspects are pivotal when working with sensitive medical data. Our project is committed to:

- Protecting patient privacy by adhering to data protection and anonymization procedures.
- Ensuring the responsible use of the predictive model, considering the potential consequences on patient healthcare.
- Complying with all applicable laws and regulations related to medical data.

## Conclusion

The goal of the "Identifying High-Risk Patients for Targeted Prevention and Intervention" project is to develop a robust predictive model using a comprehensive dataset of patient records. The selected algorithm will be rigorously evaluated and, if applicable, deployed in a real healthcare setting. Throughout the project, we prioritize thorough documentation and unwavering adherence to ethical and legal considerations.
